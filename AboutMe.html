            <p div id="left-column">My name is Matt Mahar. I'm 30 years old, am a CNC programmer and aspire to be a software developer. This blog is to simply talk about anything interesting in the world of technology. I'm writing this blog while taking a front end web development course in my journey to get my computer science degree. I think the approach of having us write a blog is great as it encourages myself and 
                others to learn and talk about some of the amazing fields that are related to computer science, as well as give us an idea of what is out there and where we might want to go. Projects that span out over the length of the course are always neat because it really puts
                what you've learned into perspective. In this case the blog will start out as plain as can be, but hopefully as I progress in learning front end web development, the content and look of this page will progress as well.
