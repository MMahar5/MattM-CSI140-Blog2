        <h3>About This Blog</h3>
        <p>To talk about anything interesting in the world of technology. I'm writing this blog while taking a front end web development course in my journey to get my computer science degree. I think the approach of having us write a blog is great as it encourages myself and 
            others to learn and talk about some of the amazing fields that are related to computer science, as well as give us an idea of what is out there and where we might want to go. Projects that span out over the length of the course are always neat because it really puts
            what you've learned into perspective. In this case the blog will start out as plain as can be, but hopefully as I progress in learning front end web development, the content and look of this page will progress as well.

        <h3><em>1/23/22</em></h3>
        <p>Something I love about computer science is how much variety is involved in what a developer might want to specialize in. This field of study can lead someone to pursuing a job in game development, cybersecurity, web development, network architecture and others, which is why I plan
            to keep an open mind in where it might take me. I've always been drawn to anything that helps a person create, innovate and solve problems. Which to me is what computer science and its realted job fields are all about. In my last post I talked about a couple topics of interest to me
            in machine learning and computer vision. While I'm not entirely sure if this is specifically the field I would like to transition into one day, I still find it fascinating and incredibly worthwhile to learn as machine learning algorithms can be just another bag of tricks a developer 
            can use to solve complex problems. It's just one of those fields where the possibilities are endless and were seeing some of the most amazing feats of technological advancement in today's society because of it. Think of self driving cars with applications like lane and collision recognition, 
            or the fact that on average a Boeing 777 pilot will manually control a plane for a whopping 7 minutes total during flight, thanks to the advanced flight management systems being used today. We also see ot within fraud detection, security cameras with facial recognition, or the 50 other products 
            we can buy right now with this technology. The list of innovations just keeps on going. Realizing the potential isn't too hard though, understanding it is what's a bit more difficult. The overall premise of ML is to identify specific patterns within data through the use 
            of statistics and algorithims for generating a process to perform a task which would enable it to continually learn from the data. This is obviously much easier said then done but what I've been focusing on is to just understand the different forms of learning and the type of algorithms involved. 
            It can be broken up farther than this but the main three forms are supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Without explaining it with a bunch of jargon, supervised learning is like using flash cards with one having a picture of an apple and the other saying this is an apple. The 
            algorithms can determine this relationship and then apply it to a bigger dataset to make educated guesses based on what it has learned. A couple examples of where this is used is in fraud detection and spam filtering. Unsupervised learning is similar but without the use of "labeled" datasets but 
            instead instructed to just find similarities, patterns or differences within a cluster of data. Reinforcement learning is just what you think it might be, where a software component will learn through experience and improving its perfomance through rewards with good actions and punishments 
            through bad ones, and the algorithms goal is usually to maximize the rewards. This is used alot in robotics and even some games like AlphaGO. This will be new for me but I've discovered that learning Python seems to be the best language for machine learning as it doesn't have as many procedures or 
            achitectures embedded into the system, making it a very simple and easy code to write. This is also nice when it comes to readability as I am learning that some machine learning algorithms can be fairly complicated. I ordered a couple great books to help me get started and I am already finding 
            out how nice the simplicity of the language is. I have also started to jump in and discover the different machine learning libraries, and so far I am finding Tensorflow and Sci-Kit might be the best ones to use.

        <h3><em>2/2/22</em></h3>
        <p>All scammers are just AI computers. Ok no not really, but don't you ever get a call, email or text and come away from it thinking, "wow I can't believe they can do that". I've said it several times and I blame decoupling. Ok no again not really, but some of the AI decoupling technology that seperates apperance
            from reality it scary and very cool all at the same time. I got a better understanding of it after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb6Bl8nUiSk">The Road to AI</a>, A Ted Talk by Lloyd Danzig. He goes over the differences in automation, machine learning, and deep learning and the ways some of it
            it is used to create things can change what the apperance of whats real and fake. He makes some good points. I love technology and see the benefits it has in so many areas of our life. From just making daily tasks a little easier to protecting us things like spam email. While it seems great, a lot of this technology
            is used by people that would want to deceive others by simply altering what a person is really seeing. What is really scary is how good it has become to the point it's nearly impossible to know the difference. Lloyd showed some pictures of people and I guarentee without knowing any better, nearly 100% of people wouldn't
            be able to see the difference. We see the downside of it in our lifes with what I mentioned before in scammers and how insanely good they are getting at tricking people. I think we can get caught up in always wanting to make things better and newer and easier but the video did make me think about the bigger picture and 
            what he said at the end in the old saying "with great power, comes great responsibility". Does that mean we should just stop? Well no, but I do think we need to be more cautious. The one thing he said at that end that also struck me which was an analogy of taking colored balls from an urn. The urn is essentially humanity 
            and new inventions or technological advancements are a different colored ball that has been removed. Colored balls would represent positive human advancements like electricity or computers. Gray balls would be something like nuclear fusion which has brought good and bad. The point was that if you take enough balls out, 
            that eventually we would create something that can't be undone and ultimately would be the downfall of our society. Yes that's not fun to think about but I do think it's real. He concluded with a point that I agree with in that data is the most important resource of our generation, and that AI will become a incredibly 
            important in keeping order and making positive change.

        <h3><em>2/5/22</em></h3>
        <p>It's pretty amazing to see how intuitive the world of programming can be. One of the cooler things about working in manuafacturing and machining was the progress technology would make on a year to year basis. Before covid, I was privilaged enough to attend IMTS or the International Manufacturing Trade Show 
            each year in Chicago. The one thing you couldn't help but realize was just how fast innovation and technology was moving. From new software features, to machine capabilities, machine learning, robotics, you name it, every year it would get bigger and better. I remember the last year I was there in 2019, The 
            VP of the company I was with at the time said to me "I don't know how we're going to keep up". At the time we we're having trouble finding quality machinists. There we're no shortage of interviews but we were in need of some skilled guys because we had just brought in two new machines, with one of them being 
            the first one of it's kind in the US made, and the other was one of two or three on the west coast. New machines came with new controls, interfaces, feature and the one thing we didn't realize was how new some of the tech really was. For example, we use a software called Vericut to run our machining simulations.
            A incredibly important software as it prevents crashes and reduces user error. Usually when you get a new machine, you would need to either send it off to the engineers from Vericut to create a machine model and set up any parameters to have it run just like it would in real life. This usually could be done in a 
            week because they already have many of the machine simulations built in to their system, they just have to make it catered to exactly how you would use it. What should have took a week, ended up taking 6 months because we soon found out these machines numerous features that don't even exist in their software. In 
            other words making it from scratch. The other issue we faced was the learning curve many of the machinists faced because much of it is completely new. This goes back to what my boss said at the time in not being able to keep up. At that time it was pretty easy to see that technology was moving faster than the industry
            and the work force. We would see new software be realeased or new machine technology being made almost yearly but to then train employees or even try hiring ones that knew about it was a real challenge. Before everything had really settled down and you have a new technological advancement implemented in a industry could
            take several years. 
            Before going to school to study computer science, I would hear how I would constantly need to keep up and that things would change all the time. One of the first things my instructor said was, "by the time you graduate, a lot of the code will be irrelevant. The main goal you want to take away from this is to learn how to learn" 
            It hasn't been too long but I'm starting to see what he means, but the cool thing about things moving fast is that things usually become smarter too. For example the new version of Visual Studio seems to be scary smart too when I started using it about a year ago. It seems to be almost too good at guessing what I want to code. 
            <a href="https://deepmind.com/research" alt="DeepMind Technologies">DeepMind Technologies</a> just came out with an AI capable of writing code on par, if not better with most programmers. It showed this in a <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode">coding challenge</a> where it placed in 
            the top 54% with other human programmers. So I guess they are taking over the world after all...  No, just kidding but I actually think it's a sign of where things could head. The thing is with technology getting more complex, data getting larger than ever, its going to take highly advanced systems to solve some of these challenges
            and I believe it could be a huge benefit for the everyday programmer. You already start to see this implemented in to some of the coding languages used today but this could help take the next step like creating coding assistants. There's still challenges and issues it faced where a human would be better but it's still a interesting 
            topic that should be watched. Some of the solutions and various problems it faced can be seen <a href="https://alphacode.deepmind.com/">here.</a>

        <h3><em>2/7/22</em></h3>
        <p><em>Quantum computing</em> is a hard subject to understand. Saying the word quantum hurts my brain so I resorted to watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuR969uMICM">video</a> that explained it by playing a coin flip game, because yes, I know how to flip a coin. So what did I find out? That I suck at flipping coins. Well at least 
            when it comes to quantum computing. The game was very simple with the coin starting showing heads. The computer goes first and chooses whether or not to flip the coin but either way you don't get to see the outcome. Then you choose whether or not to flip it and it also will not be revealed to the computer. Then the computer plays one last time 
            choosing once again whether or not to flip it and at the end if the coin is heads then the computer wins and if tails, you win. Simple enough and the odds of winning are 50:50 which was proven with a number of tests on a normal computer. The big difference came when the results were shown after playing the quantum computer. The results showed the 
            quantum computer winning 97% of the time! The only reason it lost was actually because of a few operational errors in the computer. The difference is between the way it sees the flip of the coin. Where a normal computer would see you choosing to flip the coin as a bit, either 0 or 1. The quantum computer sees it as a combination of both with some 
            probability of being one or the other. So in other words it exists on a spectrum, and this is where the word <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/superposition"><em>superposition</em></a> comes from. Its hard to understand without understanding quantum physics but when it comes to quantum computing, you have to give up your view of it 
            being either zero or one but rather just one mixture that is constantly being stirred so matter what you decide, whether to flip it or not, the mixture stays intact except in the end when the coin is to be revealed, the quantum computer can unmix this mixture and perfectly finding whether it's heads or tails. Confusing and hard to believe, I know.
            The point to focus on is the results and the potential impact this could have on our society. For example, this could be used for encryption purposes by creating private keys where a hacker would have to break the laws of quantum physics. This could also be used in finding cures and medicines as it could be used to help in breaking down describing and
            computing all of the quantum properties of atoms in the molecules used for medicinal drugs. They would be able to outperform supercomputers because it operates using the same properties of the molecule its trying to analyze. Think of the lives it could have potentially saved from covid or finding a cure for a disease like Alzheimers. One thing that was 
            new to me is the possibility of it even transmitting data by teleportation because the identities of quantum particles can get entangled across space and time and so that when you change something about a particle in point A, it can impact point b, which is the definition of teleportation. It sounds crazy and it's hard to understand or believe but then 
            again if this was around 200 years ago, would you believe we'd be able to talk to see and talk to someone halfway across the world or send information in a blink of an eye. It's why I keep an open mind and what makes it all so interesting and a topic worth learning about.

        <h3><em>2/10/22</em></h3>
        <p>I was talking with some friends the other day about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a> and long story short, there are a lot of opinions. Some don't care, some think it's the future, some think it's just a video game, regardless of what people think, virtual reality is incredibly interesting and will play a role in more than one aspect of our future lives. Yes, right now most 
            of it are just games but I think the steps that virtual reality gaming has taken makes the topic of a VR alternate universe just that much more interesting because it all doesn't seem so far fetched. Feels like yesterday when I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Cline">Ernest Cline's</a> Ready Player One and thought how cool that could be 
            (besides the part where the world is a dystopia). I bring that up though because I believe the world of gaming is going to have a huge impact on the future of a so called Metaverse. This is where <em>Microsoft</em> comes in. While Meta's VR brand did out sell the new Xbox from Microsoft in 2021, the fact is Microsoft Studios has a much bigger footpring in the world of gaming
            compared to Meta. They've developed or had their hand in a ton of popular games like Halo, Age of Empires, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Forza and more. They've also been building their own gaming empire by first buying Minecraft, which is like a metaverse in itself then ZeniMax Media and Bethesda. Which means they have the rights to games like Doom, Fallout, and The Elder Scrolls. The thing is 
            a lot of these games have huge communities like in Minecraft, or The Elder Scrolls, which is constantly changing and stays extremely popular thanks to the impact of its modders. Now Microsoft just bought Activision for a whopping 69 billion dollars! But why? Well, they do have some of the most popular games in the world
            like its Call of Duty series and Overwatch, but I believe it will be used to make their gamepass subscription more attractive. So what does this have to do with the Metaverse? Well I believe the Metaverse will evolve primarily from the gaming industry which is why I like the theory behind Microsoft making these acquisitions to have more control in the future VR world. 
            I believe the Metaverse would be hardpressed to survive without the gaming industry which would ultimately lead to gaming companies populating much of the Metaverse. This would give companies like Microsoft a huge upper hand in controlling how users access the Metaverse.The other area where a company like Microsoft has the upper hand is with software. I think they realize that 
            more and more people are not just using Windows, but also Mac and even Linux. This could where an application like Microsoft Teams becomes a big player. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wants Horizon work rooms to be the default application for virtual work but I believe it could be hard to beat someone like Microsoft. Facebook has mainly dealt with 
            consumers and they would be switching their focus to also deal with businesses, but this is where Microsoft is the big dog, who has been selling software to companies for over 40 years. This is where the embrace of the cloud and a application like Microsoft Teams can be used to span to others who have something other than just windows. Essentially if a Metaverse does happen, I think these two areas 
            in gaming and buisnesses, are going to be huge, which is where Microsoft would most likely have the upper hand. That said they still lack in a lot of other areas like the mobile industry and Apple or with Google and all of its applications and products. The fact is the Metaverse may or may not happen but if it does, ultimately Meta may have a smaller footprint in it then people think. Either way it's a 
            interesting topic and I will be curious to see what happens.
