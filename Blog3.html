        <p div id="left-column">All scammers are just AI computers. Ok no not really, but don't you ever get a call, email or text and come away from it thinking, "wow I can't believe they can do that". I've said it several times and I blame decoupling. Ok no again not really, but some of the AI decoupling technology that seperates apperance
            from reality it scary and very cool all at the same time. I got a better understanding of it after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb6Bl8nUiSk">The Road to AI</a>, A Ted Talk by Lloyd Danzig. He goes over the differences in automation, machine learning, and deep learning and the ways some of it
            it is used to create things can change what the apperance of whats real and fake. He makes some good points. I love technology and see the benefits it has in so many areas of our life. From just making daily tasks a little easier to protecting us things like spam email. While it seems great, a lot of this technology
            is used by people that would want to deceive others by simply altering what a person is really seeing. What is really scary is how good it has become to the point it's nearly impossible to know the difference. Lloyd showed some pictures of people and I guarentee without knowing any better, nearly 100% of people wouldn't
            be able to see the difference. We see the downside of it in our lifes with what I mentioned before in scammers and how insanely good they are getting at tricking people. I think we can get caught up in always wanting to make things better and newer and easier but the video did make me think about the bigger picture and 
            what he said at the end in the old saying "with great power, comes great responsibility". Does that mean we should just stop? Well no, but I do think we need to be more cautious. The one thing he said at that end that also struck me which was an analogy of taking colored balls from an urn. The urn is essentially humanity 
            and new inventions or technological advancements are a different colored ball that has been removed. Colored balls would represent positive human advancements like electricity or computers. Gray balls would be something like nuclear fusion which has brought good and bad. The point was that if you take enough balls out, 
            that eventually we would create something that can't be undone and ultimately would be the downfall of our society. Yes that's not fun to think about but I do think it's real. He concluded with a point that I agree with in that data is the most important resource of our generation, and that AI will become a incredibly 
            important in keeping order and making positive change.
