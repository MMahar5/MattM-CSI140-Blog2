        <p div id="left-column">I was talking with some friends the other day about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a> and long story short, there are a lot of opinions. Some don't care, some think it's the future, some think it's just a video game, regardless of what people think, virtual reality is incredibly interesting and will play a role in more than one aspect of our future lives. Yes, right now most 
            of it are just games but I think the steps that virtual reality gaming has taken makes the topic of a VR alternate universe just that much more interesting because it all doesn't seem so far fetched. Feels like yesterday when I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Cline">Ernest Cline's</a> Ready Player One and thought how cool that could be 
            (besides the part where the world is a dystopia). I bring that up though because I believe the world of gaming is going to have a huge impact on the future of a so called Metaverse. This is where <em>Microsoft</em> comes in. While Meta's VR brand did out sell the new Xbox from Microsoft in 2021, the fact is Microsoft Studios has a much bigger footpring in the world of gaming
            compared to Meta. They've developed or had their hand in a ton of popular games like Halo, Age of Empires, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Forza and more. They've also been building their own gaming empire by first buying Minecraft, which is like a metaverse in itself then ZeniMax Media and Bethesda. Which means they have the rights to games like Doom, Fallout, and The Elder Scrolls. The thing is 
            a lot of these games have huge communities like in Minecraft, or The Elder Scrolls, which is constantly changing and stays extremely popular thanks to the impact of its modders. Now Microsoft just bought Activision for a whopping 69 billion dollars! But why? Well, they do have some of the most popular games in the world
            like its Call of Duty series and Overwatch, but I believe it will be used to make their gamepass subscription more attractive. So what does this have to do with the Metaverse? Well I believe the Metaverse will evolve primarily from the gaming industry which is why I like the theory behind Microsoft making these acquisitions to have more control in the future VR world. 
            I believe the Metaverse would be hardpressed to survive without the gaming industry which would ultimately lead to gaming companies populating much of the Metaverse. This would give companies like Microsoft a huge upper hand in controlling how users access the Metaverse.The other area where a company like Microsoft has the upper hand is with software. I think they realize that 
            more and more people are not just using Windows, but also Mac and even Linux. This could where an application like Microsoft Teams becomes a big player. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wants Horizon work rooms to be the default application for virtual work but I believe it could be hard to beat someone like Microsoft. Facebook has mainly dealt with 
            consumers and they would be switching their focus to also deal with businesses, but this is where Microsoft is the big dog, who has been selling software to companies for over 40 years. This is where the embrace of the cloud and a application like Microsoft Teams can be used to span to others who have something other than just windows. Essentially if a Metaverse does happen, I think these two areas 
            in gaming and buisnesses, are going to be huge, which is where Microsoft would most likely have the upper hand. That said they still lack in a lot of other areas like the mobile industry and Apple or with Google and all of its applications and products. The fact is the Metaverse may or may not happen but if it does, ultimately Meta may have a smaller footprint in it then people think. Either way it's a 
            interesting topic and I will be curious to see what happens.
