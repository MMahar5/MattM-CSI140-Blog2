        <p div id="left-column">It's pretty amazing to see how intuitive the world of programming can be. One of the cooler things about working in manuafacturing and machining was the progress technology would make on a year to year basis. Before covid, I was privilaged enough to attend IMTS or the International Manufacturing Trade Show 
            each year in Chicago. The one thing you couldn't help but realize was just how fast innovation and technology was moving. From new software features, to machine capabilities, machine learning, robotics, you name it, every year it would get bigger and better. I remember the last year I was there in 2019, The 
            VP of the company I was with at the time said to me "I don't know how we're going to keep up". At the time we we're having trouble finding quality machinists. There we're no shortage of interviews but we were in need of some skilled guys because we had just brought in two new machines, with one of them being 
            the first one of it's kind in the US made, and the other was one of two or three on the west coast. New machines came with new controls, interfaces, feature and the one thing we didn't realize was how new some of the tech really was. For example, we use a software called Vericut to run our machining simulations.
            A incredibly important software as it prevents crashes and reduces user error. Usually when you get a new machine, you would need to either send it off to the engineers from Vericut to create a machine model and set up any parameters to have it run just like it would in real life. This usually could be done in a 
            week because they already have many of the machine simulations built in to their system, they just have to make it catered to exactly how you would use it. What should have took a week, ended up taking 6 months because we soon found out these machines numerous features that don't even exist in their software. In 
            other words making it from scratch. The other issue we faced was the learning curve many of the machinists faced because much of it is completely new. This goes back to what my boss said at the time in not being able to keep up. At that time it was pretty easy to see that technology was moving faster than the industry
            and the work force. We would see new software be realeased or new machine technology being made almost yearly but to then train employees or even try hiring ones that knew about it was a real challenge. Before everything had really settled down and you have a new technological advancement implemented in a industry could
            take several years. 
            Before going to school to study computer science, I would hear how I would constantly need to keep up and that things would change all the time. One of the first things my instructor said was, "by the time you graduate, a lot of the code will be irrelevant. The main goal you want to take away from this is to learn how to learn" 
            It hasn't been too long but I'm starting to see what he means, but the cool thing about things moving fast is that things usually become smarter too. For example the new version of Visual Studio seems to be scary smart too when I started using it about a year ago. It seems to be almost too good at guessing what I want to code. 
            <a href="https://deepmind.com/research" alt="DeepMind Technologies">DeepMind Technologies</a> just came out with an AI capable of writing code on par, if not better with most programmers. It showed this in a <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode">coding challenge</a> where it placed in 
            the top 54% with other human programmers. So I guess they are taking over the world after all...  No, just kidding but I actually think it's a sign of where things could head. The thing is with technology getting more complex, data getting larger than ever, its going to take highly advanced systems to solve some of these challenges
            and I believe it could be a huge benefit for the everyday programmer. You already start to see this implemented in to some of the coding languages used today but this could help take the next step like creating coding assistants. There's still challenges and issues it faced where a human would be better but it's still a interesting 
            topic that should be watched. Some of the solutions and various problems it faced can be seen <a href="https://alphacode.deepmind.com/">here.</a>
