        <h3>About This Blog</h3>
        <p>To talk about anything interesting in the world of technology. I'm writing this blog while taking a front end web development course in my journey to get my computer science degree. I think the approach of having us write a blog is great as it encourages myself and 
            others to learn and talk about some of the amazing fields that are related to computer science, as well as give us an idea of what is out there and where we might want to go. Projects that span out over the length of the course are always neat because it really puts
            what you've learned into perspective. In this case the blog will start out as plain as can be, but hopefully as I progress in learning front end web development, the content and look of this page will progress as well.

        <h3><em>1/10/22</em></h3>
        <p>One area that continues to interest me, is the progression of AI subfields like machine learning or computer vision and how they are being implemented into the world today. When I was young I use to talk about the future
            with drones, self driving cars, or people flying around with jetpacks, and they've all come true. Well, not the last one but one can dream. Seriously though, machine learning technology is at the point where netflix knows what 
            I want to watch better than I do. One place I've been able to see these technologies used is within robotic arms. Although the use of them in manufacturing is really nothing new, the continued advancement of machine learning,
            better vision sensors and end of arm tooling variety, is the reason were seeing them more and more in places like Amazon warehouses or robotic aided surgeries. That said, were still a ways off from them taking over everyones job. 
            As someone who has worked in CNC machining and programming for the past 11 years, I was able to see some of the advancements and struggles first hand, mainly with two companies, Electroimpact and Kuka robotics. I live near the Everett
            Boeing plant and several years ago they built a huge facility on to their existing building which was used to try and implement a new automated approach using these massive robotic arms. Boeing actually approached Electroimpact
            first but apprarently they declined and so they went to Kuka who accepted the challenge. There was another building offsite where the R&D was held, which had different arms somewhat enclosed with cages. They used these to test new tooling attachments and program 
            them to carry out tasks while moving on these huge automated movable platforms. I was invited to see these several times as I had a friend working for them and while it was very cool, some of the technology just wasnt there yet. They ran in to issues with speed and making 
            adjustments on the fly. There were also tight tolerances of .003 or less to hold in some places, which is the width of a hair, and with some of them being on wheels along with the sheer size, it ultimately caused them to run into too many problems. 
            They eventually scrapped the approach after 4 years. Boeing does use Electroimpact's robotic arms in several different manufacturing processes today, but it didn't cause anyone to lose their jobs. I think it shows that in many cases the human element is much 
            more important than people think. It's not to say that autonomous plane manufacturing wont ever happen either. I just think everything was attempted a little prematurely. The progression in technology doesn't stop though and it will always need people
            that know how to use, maintain, and develop it. Which I believe makes degrees in computer science, engineering or robotics just that much more important. What I love about it is just seeing where the progression in technology is headed and where it might go next.

        <h3><em>1/23/22</em></h3>
        <p>Something I love about computer science is how much variety is involved in what a developer might want to specialize in. This field of study can lead someone to pursuing a job in game development, cybersecurity, web development, network architecture and others, which is why I plan
            to keep an open mind in where it might take me. I've always been drawn to anything that helps a person create, innovate and solve problems. Which to me is what computer science and its realted job fields are all about. In my last post I talked about a couple topics of interest to me
            in machine learning and computer vision. While I'm not entirely sure if this is specifically the field I would like to transition into one day, I still find it fascinating and incredibly worthwhile to learn as machine learning algorithms can be just another bag of tricks a developer 
            can use to solve complex problems. It's just one of those fields where the possibilities are endless and were seeing some of the most amazing feats of technological advancement in today's society because of it. Think of self driving cars with applications like lane and collision recognition, 
            or the fact that on average a Boeing 777 pilot will manually control a plane for a whopping 7 minutes total during flight, thanks to the advanced flight management systems being used today. We also see ot within fraud detection, security cameras with facial recognition, or the 50 other products 
            we can buy right now with this technology. The list of innovations just keeps on going. Realizing the potential isn't too hard though, understanding it is what's a bit more difficult. The overall premise of ML is to identify specific patterns within data through the use 
            of statistics and algorithims for generating a process to perform a task which would enable it to continually learn from the data. This is obviously much easier said then done but what I've been focusing on is to just understand the different forms of learning and the type of algorithms involved. 
            It can be broken up farther than this but the main three forms are supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Without explaining it with a bunch of jargon, supervised learning is like using flash cards with one having a picture of an apple and the other saying this is an apple. The 
            algorithms can determine this relationship and then apply it to a bigger dataset to make educated guesses based on what it has learned. A couple examples of where this is used is in fraud detection and spam filtering. Unsupervised learning is similar but without the use of "labeled" datasets but 
            instead instructed to just find similarities, patterns or differences within a cluster of data. Reinforcement learning is just what you think it might be, where a software component will learn through experience and improving its perfomance through rewards with good actions and punishments 
            through bad ones, and the algorithms goal is usually to maximize the rewards. This is used alot in robotics and even some games like AlphaGO. This will be new for me but I've discovered that learning Python seems to be the best language for machine learning as it doesn't have as many procedures or 
            achitectures embedded into the system, making it a very simple and easy code to write. This is also nice when it comes to readability as I am learning that some machine learning algorithms can be fairly complicated. I ordered a couple great books to help me get started and I am already finding 
            out how nice the simplicity of the language is. I have also started to jump in and discover the different machine learning libraries, and so far I am finding Tensorflow and Sci-Kit might be the best ones to use.
