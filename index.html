        <p>One area that continues to interest me, is the progression of AI subfields like machine learning or computer vision and how they are being implemented into the world today. When I was young I use to talk about the future
        with drones, self driving cars, or people flying around with jetpacks, and they've all come true. Well, not the last one but one can dream. Seriously though, machine learning technology is at the point where netflix knows what 
        I want to watch better than I do. One place I've been able to see these technologies used is within robotic arms. Although the use of them in manufacturing is really nothing new, the continued advancement of machine learning,
        better vision sensors and end of arm tooling variety, is the reason were seeing them more and more in places like Amazon warehouses or robotic aided surgeries. That said, were still a ways off from them taking over everyones job. 
        As someone who has worked in CNC machining and programming for the past 11 years, I was able to see some of the advancements and struggles first hand, mainly with two companies, Electroimpact and Kuka robotics. I live near the Everett
        Boeing plant and several years ago they built a huge facility on to their existing building which was used to try and implement a new automated approach using these massive robotic arms. Boeing actually approached Electroimpact
        first but apprarently they declined and so they went to Kuka who accepted the challenge. There was another building offsite where the R&D was held, which had different arms somewhat enclosed with cages. They used these to test new tooling attachments and program 
        them to carry out tasks while moving on these huge automated movable platforms. I was invited to see these several times as I had a friend working for them and while it was very cool, some of the technology just wasnt there yet. They ran in to issues with speed and making 
        adjustments on the fly. There were also tight tolerances of .003 or less to hold in some places, which is the width of a hair, and with some of them being on wheels along with the sheer size, it ultimately caused them to run into too many problems. 
        They eventually scrapped the approach after 4 years. Boeing does use Electroimpact's robotic arms in several different manufacturing processes today, but it didn't cause anyone to lose their jobs. I think it shows that in many cases the human element is much 
        more important than people think. It's not to say that autonomous plane manufacturing wont ever happen either. I just think everything was attempted a little prematurely. The progression in technology doesn't stop though and it will always need people
        that know how to use, maintain, and develop it. Which I believe makes degrees in computer science, engineering or robotics just that much more important. What I love about it is just seeing where the progression in technology is headed and where it might go next.</p>
