        <p div id="left-column">Something I love about computer science is how much variety is involved in what a developer might want to specialize in. This field of study can lead someone to pursuing a job in game development, cybersecurity, web development, network architecture and others, which is why I plan
            to keep an open mind in where it might take me. I've always been drawn to anything that helps a person create, innovate and solve problems. Which to me is what computer science and its realted job fields are all about. In my last post I talked about a couple topics of interest to me
            in machine learning and computer vision. While I'm not entirely sure if this is specifically the field I would like to transition into one day, I still find it fascinating and incredibly worthwhile to learn as machine learning algorithms can be just another bag of tricks a developer 
            can use to solve complex problems. It's just one of those fields where the possibilities are endless and were seeing some of the most amazing feats of technological advancement in today's society because of it. Think of self driving cars with applications like lane and collision recognition, 
            or the fact that on average a Boeing 777 pilot will manually control a plane for a whopping 7 minutes total during flight, thanks to the advanced flight management systems being used today. We also see ot within fraud detection, security cameras with facial recognition, or the 50 other products 
            we can buy right now with this technology. The list of innovations just keeps on going. Realizing the potential isn't too hard though, understanding it is what's a bit more difficult. The overall premise of ML is to identify specific patterns within data through the use 
            of statistics and algorithims for generating a process to perform a task which would enable it to continually learn from the data. This is obviously much easier said then done but what I've been focusing on is to just understand the different forms of learning and the type of algorithms involved. 
            It can be broken up farther than this but the main three forms are supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Without explaining it with a bunch of jargon, supervised learning is like using flash cards with one having a picture of an apple and the other saying this is an apple. The 
            algorithms can determine this relationship and then apply it to a bigger dataset to make educated guesses based on what it has learned. A couple examples of where this is used is in fraud detection and spam filtering. Unsupervised learning is similar but without the use of "labeled" datasets but 
            instead instructed to just find similarities, patterns or differences within a cluster of data. Reinforcement learning is just what you think it might be, where a software component will learn through experience and improving its perfomance through rewards with good actions and punishments 
            through bad ones, and the algorithms goal is usually to maximize the rewards. This is used alot in robotics and even some games like AlphaGO. This will be new for me but I've discovered that learning Python seems to be the best language for machine learning as it doesn't have as many procedures or 
            achitectures embedded into the system, making it a very simple and easy code to write. This is also nice when it comes to readability as I am learning that some machine learning algorithms can be fairly complicated. I ordered a couple great books to help me get started and I am already finding 
            out how nice the simplicity of the language is. I have also started to jump in and discover the different machine learning libraries, and so far I am finding Tensorflow and Sci-Kit might be the best ones to use.
