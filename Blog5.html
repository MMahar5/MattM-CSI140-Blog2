            <p div id="left-column"><em>Quantum computing</em> is a hard subject to understand. Saying the word quantum hurts my brain so I resorted to watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuR969uMICM">video</a> that explained it by playing a coin flip game, because yes, I know how to flip a coin. So what did I find out? That I suck at flipping coins. Well at least 
            when it comes to quantum computing. The game was very simple with the coin starting showing heads. The computer goes first and chooses whether or not to flip the coin but either way you don't get to see the outcome. Then you choose whether or not to flip it and it also will not be revealed to the computer. Then the computer plays one last time 
            choosing once again whether or not to flip it and at the end if the coin is heads then the computer wins and if tails, you win. Simple enough and the odds of winning are 50:50 which was proven with a number of tests on a normal computer. The big difference came when the results were shown after playing the quantum computer. The results showed the 
            quantum computer winning 97% of the time! The only reason it lost was actually because of a few operational errors in the computer. The difference is between the way it sees the flip of the coin. Where a normal computer would see you choosing to flip the coin as a bit, either 0 or 1. The quantum computer sees it as a combination of both with some 
            probability of being one or the other. So in other words it exists on a spectrum, and this is where the word <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/superposition"><em>superposition</em></a> comes from. Its hard to understand without understanding quantum physics but when it comes to quantum computing, you have to give up your view of it 
            being either zero or one but rather just one mixture that is constantly being stirred so matter what you decide, whether to flip it or not, the mixture stays intact except in the end when the coin is to be revealed, the quantum computer can unmix this mixture and perfectly finding whether it's heads or tails. Confusing and hard to believe, I know.
            The point to focus on is the results and the potential impact this could have on our society. For example, this could be used for encryption purposes by creating private keys where a hacker would have to break the laws of quantum physics. This could also be used in finding cures and medicines as it could be used to help in breaking down describing and
            computing all of the quantum properties of atoms in the molecules used for medicinal drugs. They would be able to outperform supercomputers because it operates using the same properties of the molecule its trying to analyze. Think of the lives it could have potentially saved from covid or finding a cure for a disease like Alzheimers. One thing that was 
            new to me is the possibility of it even transmitting data by teleportation because the identities of quantum particles can get entangled across space and time and so that when you change something about a particle in point A, it can impact point b, which is the definition of teleportation. It sounds crazy and it's hard to understand or believe but then 
            again if this was around 200 years ago, would you believe we'd be able to talk to see and talk to someone halfway across the world or send information in a blink of an eye. It's why I keep an open mind and what makes it all so interesting and a topic worth learning about.
